# Question 1

### **1. Which objections still carry some weight?t**  
Turing’s paper addresses objections ranging from theological concerns to mathematical limitations. 

**a. The Argument from Consciousness**  
Turing dismisses the claim that machines lack consciousness by shifting focus to observable behavior: “According to the most extreme form of this view, the only way to know a machine thinks is to be the machine” (p. 11). However, modern philosophers like John Searle contend that mimicking behavior ≠ understanding. While AI systems like ChatGPT produce human-like text, they lack subjective experience or intentionality. This distinction remains unresolved, as Turing’s test sidesteps consciousness rather than refuting its necessity.  

**b. The Mathematical Objection**  
Gödel’s incompleteness theorems suggest machines cannot resolve all logical problems. Turing counters that humans share similar limitations (p. 10), but Roger Penrose later argued human cognition involves non-computable processes. While Turing’s universal machine concept (p. 8) allows mimicking any discrete-state system, debates persist about whether human reasoning transcends algorithmic computation.  

**c. The Argument from Informality of Behavior**  
Turing concedes humans lack a “definite set of rules” (p. 16) but asserts machines could simulate informal behavior through programming. Modern AI struggles with context-dependent reasoning (e.g., understanding sarcasm) and common sense. For example, large language models often fail to grasp implicit meaning, highlighting the enduring gap between rule-based systems and human intuition.

### **2. Are his refutations valid?**  

- **Consciousness**: His analogy to solipsism—“the polite convention that everyone thinks” (p. 11)—avoids addressing subjective experience. While valid within his behaviorist framework, it does not resolve whether machines possess internal states akin to human consciousness.  
- **Lady Lovelace’s Objection**: Turing argues machines can exhibit originality if programmed to learn (p. 14–15). Modern AI, like AlphaGo’s novel strategies, validates this refutation. However, creativity rooted in data patterns (e.g., DALL-E generating art) differs from human inspiration, leaving the objection partially intact.  
- **Mathematical Limits**: Turing’s claim that humans and machines share computational constraints (p. 10) holds, but Penrose’s quantum mind hypothesis illustrates unresolved debates about non-algorithmic cognition.

### **3. Since he wrote the paper, can you think of new objections arising from developments?**  

**a. Ethical and Bias Challenges**  
Turing overlooked ethical implications. Modern AI systems perpetuate biases (e.g., racial disparities in facial recognition) and enable misinformation. Unlike Turing’s focus on intelligence, today’s discourse prioritizes accountability, fairness, and transparency—issues absent from his 1950 framework.  

**b. Explainability**  
Neural networks’ “black box” nature complicates trust. For instance, medical AI diagnosing diseases without interpretable reasoning poses risks. Turing’s assumption that programming could replicate human logic (p. 5) underestimates the complexity of modern models.  

**c. Embodiment and Sensory Experience**  
Philosophers like Hubert Dreyfus argue intelligence requires physical interaction with the world. While Turing dismisses physicality (p. 2), embodied AI (e.g., robots) still lags in sensorimotor adaptability, reinforcing this objection.

### **4. Turing’s Prediction: A 30% Success Rate by 2000**  

- **2000 Milestones**: Early chatbots (e.g., ALICE) lacked conversational depth. IBM’s Deep Blue (1997) excelled in chess but not language.  
- **Post-2000 Progress**: In 2014, Eugene Goostman reportedly convinced 33% of judges by posing as a Ukrainian teen—a controversial but symbolic milestone.  
- **2024 State**: LLMs like GPT-4 excel in short dialogues but falter in sustained coherence and contextual depth. Turing’s timeline was slightly premature, but his vision of conversational fluency aligns with modern achievements.
