# Question 1

### **1. Which objections still carry some weight??**  
Turing tackled nine arguments against machine intelligence. Three still resonate:  

**a. Consciousness**  
Turing shrugged off this concern, saying: *If a machine acts like it’s thinking, why doubt it?* He compared it to assuming other humans have minds—we just go along with it (p. 11). But critics like John Searle argue there’s a catch. Imagine a person in a room following rules to translate Chinese without understanding a word. That’s how AI works: it mimics but doesn’t *feel*. ChatGPT might write a poem, but does it *care* about beauty? This gap—between behavior and inner experience—keeps the debate alive.  

**b. Mathematical Objection**  
Some said machines can’t solve every problem because of Gödel’s math theorems. Turing replied: *Humans aren’t perfect either* (p. 10). But physicist Roger Penrose later claimed human brains use “quantum magic” beyond algorithms. Think of it like this: Can a robot ever have a gut feeling? We’re still not sure.  

**c. Argument from Informality of Behavior**  
Turing admitted humans don’t follow strict rules (p. 16) but thought machines could fake it. Fast-forward to today: AI still stumbles over sarcasm or context. For example, if you tell a chatbot, “Nice job breaking the internet,” it might reply earnestly instead of sensing the joke. The takeaway? Machines are great at patterns, bad at nuance.

### **2. Are his refutations valid?**  

- **Consciousness**: Turing’s “let’s pretend” approach works for a test, but it’s like saying a parrot understands Shakespeare because it recites lines. We still wonder: Can silicon ever *feel*?  
- **Creativity**: He argued machines could learn to be original, like kids (p. 14–15). Today, AI like AlphaGo invents chess moves no human taught it. But is that creativity—or just fancy math? Picasso’s art comes from emotions; DALL-E’s comes from data. Not quite the same.  
- **Math Limits**: Turing’s “humans aren’t perfect either” holds up, but Penrose’s quantum ideas keep the door open for human uniqueness.

### **3. Since he wrote the paper, can you think of new objections arising from developments?**  

**a. AI Is Biased and Unfair**  
Turing didn’t foresee facial recognition misidentifying people of color or chatbots echoing harmful stereotypes. Imagine a hiring AI that favors “John” over “Jamal” because it learned from biased resumes. Today, fixing these flaws is as urgent as building smarter machines.  

**b. AI Is a Black Box**  
Modern neural networks are like chefs who won’t share recipes. If a medical AI misdiagnoses you, doctors can’t ask, *Why?* Turing assumed programming would mirror human logic (p. 5), but AI today is more mystery than math.  

**c. Robots Need Bodies to Be Smart**  
Philosophers argue intelligence isn’t just brains—it’s interacting with the world. A toddler learns “hot” by touching a stove; a robot needs sensors to get it. While Turing downplayed physicality (p. 2), today’s robots still fumble tasks as simple as folding laundry.

### **4. Was Turing’s 2000 Prediction Realistic?**  
He guessed machines would fool 30% of people by 2000. Here’s how it played out:  
- **2000**: Chatbots like ALICE sounded robotic. IBM’s Deep Blue beat chess champions but couldn’t chat about the weather.  
- **Post 2000**: A chatbot named Eugene Goostman tricked 33% of judges by pretending to be a snarky Ukrainian teen—though critics called it a parlor trick.  
- **2024**: ChatGPT writes essays and jokes, but ask it to plan a birthday party, and it might suggest serving “cake” made of cardboard. Close, but not quite human.
