# Question 3

In the domain of autonomous drone delivery, imagine a smart drone that picks up packages and flies them across a city to deliver them safely and efficiently. The environment it operates in is quite accessible since it receives solid data from GPS, weather forecasts, and traffic updates. However, it may not capture every moving obstacle in real-time, so while most conditions are predictable, unexpected challenges like sudden gusts of wind or new obstacles can add some randomness. Each delivery is treated as a separate mission thus episodic in nature. Even though the drone continuously manages tasks like battery life throughout the day. The surroundings are dynamic too, with weather, traffic, and temporary no-fly zones constantly changing, and the drone navigates through a continuous 3D space where speed, direction, and altitude shift fluidly. Given all this, a hierarchical, model based agent architecture is best suited for the task.
The drone mixes data from cameras, LiDAR, GPS, and motion sensors. This combo helps it move through rain or fog and avoid surprises.

A two-layer system keeps it efficient and safe:

**Planner:** Maps out routes and schedules deliveries. 

**Controller:** Handles real-time flying. Using techniques like reinforcement learning, it dodges obstacles and adjusts to wind.

The drone uses a hierarchical, layered model based system to work efficiently. At the top level, a central planner maps out delivery routes and manages tasks, ensuring everything stays organized. At the lower level, a real-time controller handles immediate actionsâ€”like steering around obstacles or adjusting flight paths mid-air. This controller learns from past experiences and predicts the safest moves to stay on track. The drone combines data from GPS, cameras, and sensors to stay fully aware of its surroundings, creating a clear and reliable view of the environment.
