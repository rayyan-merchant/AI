### 1. An agent that senses only partial information about the state cannot be perfectly rational.
**FALSE:** A poker-playing AI agent can not see the opponents cards but still acts rationally and
makes guesses and maximises its winning potential based on probability, past actions..

### 2. There exist task environments in which no pure reflex agent can behave rationally.
**TRUE:** since simple reflex agents are programmed to work in simple environments and
environments like poker or chess would require them to think strategically and plan and so they
would struggle.

### 3. There exists a task environment in which every agent is rational.
**FALSE:** a simple reflex agent woudnot be rational in maze game as it works on fully observable
environment ut a goal-based agent would be rational as it has a specific goal to which it is
working towards.

### 4. The input to an agent program is the same as the input to the agent function.
**FALSE:** Agent Function is the mapping of the percept sequence to actions while Agent Program
is the implementation of that specific function.

### 5. Every agent function is implementable by some program/machine combination.
**FALSE:** Some agent functions are incomutable in real-time finite resources. Such as the Halting
Problem which requires infinite computation.

### 6. Suppose an agent selects its action uniformly at random from the set of possible actions. There exists a deterministic task environment in which this agent is rational.
**TRUE:** An agent acting uniformly can be rational as in the lottery game where each action lead
to an expected outcome. Random selection is as rational as any other strategy.

### 7. It is possible for a given agent to be perfectly rational in two distinct task environments.
**TRUE:** a sorting algorithm would be rational for oth array sorting and normal database sorting.
