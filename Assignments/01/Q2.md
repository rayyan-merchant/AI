# Question 2

1. **Play Table Tennis**  
   AI powered robots like those from Google DeepMind can rally with beginners and even return some tricky shots. They use cameras and quick algorithms to track the ball but when ask them to handle a pro’s spin or a fast smash, and they’ll miss like a rookie. They cannot match the technique and skill of professional players.
   
3. **Play Competitive Bridge**  
   AI can memorize rules and basic strategies, making it decent against casual players. But bridge isn’t just a card game. It’s teamwork, bluffing, and reading partners. Current bots (like NukkAI) might bid well, but they’re clueless when a human partner bluffs and says, “Trust me.” Unlike Chess where AI has performed really well, it still has a lot to do in games where human intelligence is involved.  

4. **Write a Funny Story**  
   Models like ChatGPT can generate humorous stories that some readers might enjoy. However, since humor is very subjective and relies on timing and cultural context, the results can be hit or miss.  

5. **Give Legal Advice**  
   AI tools like ROSS Intelligence can scan laws and past cases faster than a group of 4 people. But ask it to navigate a messy divorce or a niche tax loophole? It’ll spit out generic advice like "consult a lawyer”. Hence they lack the deep, context specific understanding required to give truly competent legal advice in specialized areas.

6. **Discover a Math Theorem**  
   AI is great at crunching numbers and spotting patterns, but creating a groundbreaking theorem is not what AI is capable of. However, with new reasoning models, it can be a  huge help to understand steps and concepts to get to the final output.

7. **Perform Surgery**  
   Robots like the da Vinci system help surgeons with steady hands and zoomed-in precision. But fully automating the surgery is not yet possible since during surgeries there is a need for real time decision making, adaptability

8. **Unload Any Dishwasher**  
   Lab robots can neatly stack plates… if everything’s perfectly placed. But in the varied, messy environment of a typical home, they aren’t yet versatile enough to handle the task reliably.

9. **Construct a Building**  
   Automated systems can lay bricks or 3D-print building components. however, the complex and on site decision making while construction requires human intelligence.
